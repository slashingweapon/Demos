This has various odds and ends that people might want to look at:

	- examplesInPhp contains a very limited number of one-off files that are 
	  intended to show my coding and commenting style.
	  
	- ssumaps contains some PHP and JavaScript code I wrote for Sonoma State
	  University.  I was asked just to do the code, not the styling or even
	  most of the map contents.  Also, I was very restricted in what technology
	  I had available.  See the REAME file for more information.
	
More comming soon...
